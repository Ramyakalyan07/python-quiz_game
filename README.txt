I learned how to make a quiz game using Python.
I used input() to get answers from the user.
I used if-else to check if the answer is right or wrong.
I used loops to ask many questions.
I created a function to keep my code clean.
It helped me understand how Python works.
I learned about using variables, if-else conditions, loops, and functions.
It also helped me understand how to take user input and give dynamic feedback.
